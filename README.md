# Modeling-Genotype-Mutations-And-Traits

### Steps: 
#### 1. Described and explored the raw data 
#### 2. Cleaned data 
#### 3. Applied Normalization Techniques 
#### 4. Fit a model for one of the traits (while accounting for respective trait covariates) and measure which mutation(s) best predicts the trait

### Data:
#### 1. raw data
#### 2. descriptions of the traits and covariates for each one of them
#### 3. small subset of the genotypes

##### Note: mutations randomly subsetted, so it's unlikely that the model will fit well
